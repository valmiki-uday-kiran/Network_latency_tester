# Network Latency Tester Enhancement Plan

## Current State Analysis
- Basic latency measurement using socket connection time
- Single-threaded execution
- No jitter, RTT, or packet loss calculations
- Basic file operations for data storage

## Enhancement Goals
1. **Add Advanced Metrics**:
   - Jitter calculation (variation in latency)
   - Round-Trip Time (RTT) measurement
   - Packet loss percentage calculation

2. **Implement Multithreading**:
   - Non-blocking parallel pings
   - Improved throughput and scalability
   - Configurable thread pool size

3. **Enhanced Statistics**:
   - Average latency calculation
   - Minimum/maximum latency tracking
   - Standard deviation of latency
   - Comprehensive test reports

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - 70% throughput improvement target
   - 95% reliability in bottleneck detection
   - 80% diagnostic accuracy improvement

## Implementation Approach
- Use Python's `threading` module for parallel execution
- Implement statistical calculations for advanced metrics
- Add configuration options for test parameters
- Enhance data storage for comprehensive results
- Update README with new features and usage

## Expected Outcomes
- Professional-grade network diagnostic tool
- Enterprise-level performance monitoring capabilities
- Scalable architecture for large-scale testing
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics
