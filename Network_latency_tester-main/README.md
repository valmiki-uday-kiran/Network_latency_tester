# Network Latency Tester

A comprehensive Python-based tool for measuring network performance metrics including latency, jitter, packet loss, and RTT. This application provides enterprise-grade network diagnostics with multithreading support for high-performance testing.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Latency Measurement**: Measure network latency to any host and port combination
- **Round-Trip Time (RTT)**: Accurate RTT measurement for TCP connections
- **Jitter Calculation**: Measure variation in latency between tests
- **Packet Loss Analysis**: Calculate packet loss percentage across multiple tests
- **Multithreaded Testing**: Parallel execution for improved throughput and scalability

### Advanced Features
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Average, min, max, median latency with standard deviation
- **Configuration Management**: JSON-based configuration storage
- **Result Export**: JSON export for detailed analysis and reporting
- **Test History**: Track historical test results with timestamps
- **Interactive Menu**: User-friendly command-line interface

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your system
3. No additional dependencies required - uses only Python standard library modules

   Default number of tests: 10
   Default timeout (seconds): 5
   ```

2. **Run comprehensive parallel test:**
   ```
   Performing 10 parallel tests to google.com:443...
   Comprehensive test recorded - ID: parallel_20231201_143022
     Successful tests: 9/10
     Packet loss: 10.0%
     Avg latency: 45.23 ms
     Jitter: 3.15 ms
   ```

3. **Export results:**
   ```
   Results exported to network_test_results.json
   ```

## Performance Metrics

The advanced version provides comprehensive network diagnostics:

- **Latency**: Connection establishment time in milliseconds
- **Jitter**: Variation in latency between consecutive tests
- **Packet Loss**: Percentage of failed connection attempts
- **RTT**: Round-trip time for TCP connections
- **Statistical Analysis**: Mean, median, min, max, standard deviation

## Technical Specifications

- **Multithreading**: Up to 15 concurrent threads (configurable)
- **Timeout**: Configurable connection timeout (default: 5 seconds)
- **Test Volume**: Configurable number of tests per run (default: 10)
- **Data Storage**: JSON format for configuration and results
- **Export Format**: Standard JSON for easy integration with other tools
